# Reviewing File

## What difficulties did I encounter?
I ran into many problems. I wanted to change the background to black and the text to white, but after running the code, everything after the `<audio>` tag disappeared.

## How did I find the problem?
I spent almost an hour searching. I thought it was a CSS issue, and GPT gave me several answers, but none of them solved the problem.

## What was the real mistake?
I only wrote `<audio>` but forgot to close it with `</audio>`. Because of this, the browser couldn’t read anything after the audio tag.

## What did I learn?
I learned to always check whether HTML tags are properly closed. A small mistake can break the entire page.


## **1. Choosing the Theme and Solving CSS Issues**   
The first step was deciding that I wanted to create a cat-themed website. I tried using many external links and a lot of CSS to decorate the page, but I quickly realized that adding too much CSS kept breaking my webpage. I didn't understand where the problem came from, so I deleted most of the code and started again from scratch.


## **2. Creating the Meowfia Artwork**   
Next, I used an AI image-generation tool to create the Meowfia cat images. These visuals became the main style and personality of my website.


## **3. Adding Images and Audio**   
After finishing the visuals, I added JPG, PNG, and an audio element. Because of copyright restrictions, I couldn’t directly use Apple Music as my MP3 source. Instead, I used a YouTube-to-MP3 website to get the audio I needed and finally completed the sound section of my project.
